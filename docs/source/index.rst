Abstract
-----------------
The purpose of this project is to design, implement, test, and experiment with a controller that will enable a spacecraft to maintain a stable, fixed orientation. This will have to be done despite noisy sensor measurements from the star sensor on the spacecraft and an obstacle in the form of a shooting star. Simulation experiments will be conducted to test the validity of the designed controller.
